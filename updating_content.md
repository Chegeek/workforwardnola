# Updating content

## HTML & page content
The basic html for each page can be found in a `*.mustache` file in the `/templates` directory.

* Homepage/front page: `index.mustache`
* Header & footer: `layout.mustache` (this "wraps" all the other pages)
* Assessment (me/not me quiz): `assessment.mustache` 
* Careers (results): `careers.mustache` (How to update the career content is covered below)
